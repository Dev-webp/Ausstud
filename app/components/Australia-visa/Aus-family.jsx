      <h4><b>Types of Australia Family Visas</b></h4>
      <br />
      <h5><b>1.	Partner Visa (Subclass 820 & 801)</b></h5>
      
      <p>For married or de facto couples, the Partner Visa allows one partner to live in Australia while waiting for the permanent visa. It includes two stages:</p>
      <br />
        <ul className='ml-8 list-disc'>
        <li><b>Temporary Visa (Subclass 820):</b> Granted initially, allowing you to stay in Australia while your application is processed.</li>
        <li><b>Permanent Visa (Subclass 801):</b> This visa is granted once you’ve proven the genuineness of your relationship over time.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>Whether you are in a married or de facto relationship, the Partner Visa provides a pathway to permanent residency for your spouse or partner.</p>
      <br />
      
      <h5><b>2.	Parent Visa (Subclass 103 & 804)</b></h5>
      
      <p>If you have children living in Australia and wish to be close to them, the Parent Visa is the ideal option. There are several types, but the most common ones are:</p>
      <br />
       <ul className='ml-8 list-disc'>
       <li><b>Parent Visa (Subclass 103): </b> A permanent visa for parents of Australian citizens, permanent residents, or eligible New Zealand citizens. This visa allows you to join your family in Australia on a permanent basis.</li>
       <li><b>Contributory Parent Visa (Subclass 143): </b> A quicker option, but with a higher application fee. It allows for faster processing and grants permanent residency.</li>
       </ul>
        <br />
        <p>Whether you are in a married or de facto relationship, the Partner Visa provides a pathway to permanent residency for your spouse or partner.</p>
        <br /> 
        
      <h5><b>3.	Child Visa (Subclass 101 & 802)</b></h5>
      
      <p>Parents who are Australian citizens or permanent residents can sponsor their children to join them in Australia.</p>
      <br />
        <ul className='ml-8 list-disc'>
        <li><b>Child Visa (Subclass 101):</b> Granted initially, allowing you to stay in Australia while your application is processed.</li>
        <li><b>Adoption Visa (Subclass 102):</b> This visa is granted once you’ve proven the genuineness of your relationship over time.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>This visa is also available for stepchildren, biological children, and those in the legal custody of the applicant.</p>
        <br />
        
      <h5><b>4.	Other Family Member Visas</b></h5>
      
      <p>Besides the immediate family members, Australia also offers options for extended family members to migrate. These include:</p>
      <br />
        <ul className='list-disc ml-8'>
        <li><b>Aged Dependent Relative Visa (Subclass 114): </b> Granted initially, allowing you to stay in Australia while your application is processed.</li>
        <li><b>Remaining Relative Visa (Subclass 115)</b> This visa is granted once you’ve proven the genuineness of your relationship over time.</li>
        <li><b>Carer Visa (Subclass 116):</b>For those who are required to provide personal care to an Australian relative with a medical condition. </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        
      <h5><b>5.	Visitor Visas for Family Visits</b></h5>
    
      <p>If your primary intention is to visit your family in Australia temporarily, the <b>Visitor Visa (Subclass 600)</b> may be an option. While this visa doesn’t offer permanent residency, it allows you to stay in Australia for up to 12 months while spending time with your loved ones.</p>
